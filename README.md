This is an ongoing project. It's close to being culminated but still has some features pending. 
Is made using javaScript and Vuejs. It consumes a free API from RapidAPI. It is my second fast project using Vuejs, probably it doesn't have implemented the best practices but it's intended to be a quick approach to Vuejs's syntaxis.
